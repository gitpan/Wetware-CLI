	 	This is the proof in the pudding that one just sub classes
	 	the Wetware::CLI in the script and goes from there.

		Hey, what if there were a way to filter in Test::Load
		why then we could have a simpler solution to our problem
		and for all FOO there would be a FOO::TestSuite
		
		WOW.
		
		Now all we need is a tool to gin up the minimum for
		FOO::TestSuite for all FOO, or at least validate that
		they exist.

		fix pod. Round out the test suite. look at the idea of
		running the code with some sort of 
		
		    t/lib/Wetware/CLI/TestSuite/Stub.pm
		
		but that just seems like more work.

	Have opted to create a Wetware::Test distribution that will deliver
	the basic Test::Class::Load module - As well as our basic TestSuite 
	core set of methods.

	There is the problem, that since Wetware::CLI::TestSuite.pm is going to be
	in blib, it will cause problems for both

	t/pod-coverage.t

	and the t/00_compile_pm.t strategy of:

		use strict;
		use warnings;
		use Test::Compile;
		BEGIN { all_pm_files_ok(); }
	
	If we do not put it in the BEGIN block then we run into the problem
	of the INIT {} block for the Test::Class that runs too late, eg:
	
	t/00_compile_pm.t ............. 1/2 Too late to run INIT block at 
	  /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Wetware/Test/Class.pm line 22.
	
	In the BEGIN Block, we have the problem that it sees 
	
	t/00_compile_pm.t ............. 1/2 # Looks like you planned 2 tests but ran 7 extra.
    t/00_compile_pm.t ............. Dubious, test returned 255 (wstat 65280, 0xff00)
    All 2 subtests passed 

	This suggest a problem - that the t/lib/*/TestSuite.pm will be
	runable with the basic 
		
		use strict;
		use warnings;
		use FindBin qw($Bin);
		use Test::Class::Load "$Bin/../lib/Wetware/CLI";
	
	which is normally Loading 
		use Test::Class::Load "$Bin/t/lib/";

    to find all of the TestSuite modules...
    
    What ever to Do.

	basic shape, but what if we want to export the Test::Class
	based TestSuite?
